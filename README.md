## Description
Cases for stacking [Korg Volcas](https://www.korg-volca.com/) while in transport or storage. 

The system consists of a top/lid, middle sections that nest a Volca on another Volca, and another middle that nests the tangible waves vMix10 on the bottom of the stack. Stack as many as you'd like, by printing more middles.

## Notes
- Fits on Prusa Mk3 or similar size printer
- Support modeled in place, easily removes
- I printed in PETG for durability, but don't be so rough on your synths
- If your printer is well calibrated, you get a decent snap fit on the top of each Volca
- Strap the stack to secure it together, I prefer cable wrap velcro, but use what you've got
