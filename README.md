## Description
Cases for stacking [Korg Volcas](https://www.korg-volca.com/) while in transport or storage. 

The system consists of a top/lid, middle sections that nest a Volca on another Volca, and another middle that nests the tangible waves vMix10 on the bottom of the stack. Stack as many as you'd like, by printing more middles.
